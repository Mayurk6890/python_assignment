Que 1. Understanding Pythonâ€™s PEP 8 guidelines.
Ans =  PEP 8 (Python Enhancement Proposal 8)
       PEP 8 is a set of rules for writing clean and readable Python code. the main guidelines :
       1. INDENTATION  - Use 4 space for each indentation level.
       2. LINE LENGHT  - Keep lines under 79 characters.
       3. BLANK LINES  - Use blank lines to separate code blocks.
       4. IMPORTS      - Group imports and put them at the top of the file.
       5. WHITESPACE   - Use spaces around operators and after commas.
       6. NAMING:      - Use snake_case for variables and functions, CamelCase for classes, and 
                         ALL_CAPS for constants.
       7. COMMENTS     - Inline Comments: Use a space after the # symbol and ensure the comment 
                         adds value

Que 2. Indentation, comments, and naming conventions in Python.
Ans =  INDENTATION - Python uses indentation to define blocks of code, 
                     unlike other languages that use curly braces {}.
                     Use 4 spaces per indentation level. Avoid tabs.

       COMMENT     -  2 types of comments :
                      (1) Single line comment use the # symbol
                      (2) Multi-line comment use the ("""/ """) or docstrings (""")

       NAMING      - Follow Python's PEP 8 guidelines for consistent naming of variables,
                     functions, classes, and constants. 
       =======================================================================================

Que 3. Writing readable and maintainable code.
Ans =  Use clear names:
            age is better than x
            calculate_area is better than func1
      
       Indentation matters:
            Use 4 spaces to show what code belongs together.
       
       Comment your code:
            Explain what your code does, especially for tricky parts.
            
       Break down big problems:
            Divide large tasks into smaller, easier-to-solve steps.
      
       Test your code:
            Try different inputs to make sure your code works correctly.
